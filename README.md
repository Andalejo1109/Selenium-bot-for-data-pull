Python coding for data pulling and webchrome navigation

Instructions to develop it:

Adding Videos to GitHub:

Direct Uploads:
GitHub does support uploading video files directly into repositories, issues, and pull requests. However, there are file size limitations.   
For repositories with free github plans, the limit is 10MB. For paid plans it is 100MB.
You can directly add video files to your repository and then link to them within your README.md.

Linking to External Video Hosting:
A common practice is to upload your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo and then embed or link to them in your README.md. This is particularly useful for larger video files.
For youtube you can also use a thumbnail picture of the video, and link that picture to the youtube video.   
Using GIFs:
For shorter demonstrations, consider creating animated GIFs. These can be easily embedded in your README.md and are often sufficient to show the bot's basic behavior.   
Handling Sensitive Information:

Here's how to create a demonstration without revealing sensitive labor information:

Anonymize Data:
If possible, modify your bot to work with anonymized or dummy data. Replace real names, addresses, and other sensitive details with placeholder values.
Selective Recording:
Record only the parts of the bot's operation that are relevant to demonstrating its functionality. Avoid capturing screens or actions that reveal sensitive information.
Obfuscation:
If you must show certain parts of the interface, use video editing software to blur or pixelate sensitive areas.
Focus on Functionality:
Concentrate on showing the bot's workflow and the steps it takes. For example, you can demonstrate how it navigates websites, fills out forms, or extracts data, without necessarily showing the specific data being processed.
Create a Demo Environment:
Set up a separate, isolated environment for your demonstration. This environment should contain only non-sensitive data.
Textual Explanations:
Supplement your video with detailed textual explanations in your README.md. Describe the bot's purpose, features, and how it works, without relying solely on the video.
Git Large File Storage (LFS):
If you have large video files, you can use Git LFS to manage them within your repository. This allows you to store large files outside of your Git repository while keeping references to them.   
Example Scenario:

Instead of showing your bot scraping real customer data, create a demonstration that scrapes publicly available data from a website like Wikipedia.
Record a video showing the bot navigating the website and extracting information.
In your README.md, explain that the bot can be adapted to scrape other websites and process different types of data.
By following these steps, you can effectively showcase your Selenium bot's capabilities while protecting sensitive information.
